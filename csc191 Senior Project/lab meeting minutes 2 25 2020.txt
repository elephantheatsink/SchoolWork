prof was able to run the web app
prof asked us what work we're currently doing

beomjin asked prof if there is any development strategies to combat constant npm install/compile, which takes a lot of time
austin talked about the difficulties we had with gitlab and strategies

we need backlog for sprint 6, send to prof
maybe ask the business department regarding some of the technical difficulties regarding visualization

prof is pleased with our progress and the distribution of our work

keep documentation and visualization for organizing the sprints

next time, there will be a 2 minute presentation for everyone at the lab meeting
 
oral presentation is at the end of april, preferably we have a finished product before then

we have about 4 sprints left
