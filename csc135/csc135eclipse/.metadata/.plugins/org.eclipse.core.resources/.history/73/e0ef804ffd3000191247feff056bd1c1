//CSC 140 Homework 2 - Programming portion
//Basically, this program is an infinite loop that keeps asking for array lengths.
//Once it gets the length of the array, it generates the elements with random numbers.
//Times are recorded immediately before and after the sorting method is called.
//After every input in the loop, it displays the array in sorted order and the time taken on the next line.
//My test cases were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10.
//As expected, when the graph was plotted Time vs Array Length, it resembled the positive side
//of an x^2 function. There were very minute deviations.

//I'm sorry I didn't put together the homework pdf in time. (which includes my test cases screenshot and the graph)
//I'll submit the revised version sometime this weekend.
