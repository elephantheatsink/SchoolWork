Dear students,
There is an typo error in Question #4 in Assignment2.
The last transition has this error:
Q2 on 0, 1 transitions to Q1
Change it to:
Q2 on 0, 1 (0 and 1) transitions to Q2. 
So in short the last state has a transition on 0,1 on to itself (to represent any string).
Cheers,
Jagan

 
In Question #4 the ' (quote) in front of (Q2) is missing.
(DFA-Acceptor ‘(1 1 0 1 0) Q0 (Q2) P) returns #t
and
(DFA-Acceptor ‘(1 0 0) Q0 (Q2) P) returns #f

(DFA-Acceptor ‘(1 1 0 1 0) Q0 '(Q2) P) returns #t
and
(DFA-Acceptor ‘(1 0 0) Q0 '(Q2) P) returns #f

SUGGESTIONS:
How can we convert the list of names:  '(Q2) to a list containing the function for Q2?   
Solution:
Given a list M of  names (the state function names),
just call:
(map eval M)
to evaluate each name to the corresponding 
function with the same name in the list.
(map eval '(Q2) ) will convert the list of names to a list of functions with the same names.
Also for Question #2:
use the following definition to convert a list of letters to a string:
(define (convert-to-string List) (eval (cons string-append (map symbol->string List))))
(convert-to-string '(a b c d))
returns:
"abcd"
Make sure you test with only letters as elements of the lists.
cheers,
Jagan
