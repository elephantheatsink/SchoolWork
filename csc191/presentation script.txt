Hi, my name is Beomjin Han, I'll be talking about deployment of the website.
When we discussed with the client about deploying the website, making the website go live, our client
was very specific that he wanted to use GoDaddy.com for this project. 
His company had a couple wordpress websites that were hosted by GoDaddy, and he wanted to
put this new website on the same account, for convenience.

You can see the deployment diagram on the right side. The database and web server
are on different devices. The databases are hosted on the cloud service provided by MongoDB.
The client web browser interacts with the react app that's on the godaddy server.
The user can now access the sprinkler database which contains the visualization files.
The visualization app communicates with the user database that's on the MongoDB cloud as well.

GoDaddy provided cPanel services, and we used a ssh client and file transfer client to move files and install the environment and application.

Deployment was not a requirement but the process of deployment is currently in progress
The front end works and is up and running.
The backend requires permissions from the client 
  so we've mostly passed the torch onto Terry to get that up.

I'll now pass it on to Sean Foley for the next slide.


we're going to set up a virtual machine in the godaddy server that can communicate with the mongodb cloud
there's also an option for the client to purchase a dedicated VPS
