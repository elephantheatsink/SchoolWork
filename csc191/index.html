<h3>Background</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Terry Fay from Fire Risk Alliance wanted us to build a website that organizes fire <br> 
	sprinklers and their spray patterns.<br> 

</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	The client needs a standalone webpage where users would log in and have access to a <br> 
	subset of a database of sprinklers. The customers would be able to view the sprinkler <br>
	spray patters that are displayed on the webpage.<br>

</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	We used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) for the website. <br>
	We used D3.js for the visualization of the sprinkler patterns <br>
	

</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our client was interested in doing this project for a long time. He told us <br>
	this sort of website did not exist yet, and how his job would be much easier if <br>
	it was made. 
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Coding and development for Node.js and react was done mostly in Visual Studio Code.<br>
	MongoDB cloud database was managed through MongoDB Compass application.<br>
	For version control, we used the GitLab account provided by the school.<br>
	To manually test the functionality and view the website, we used various web browsers <br>
	such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.<br>
	Deployment was done with GoDaddy, cPanel, and PuTTY. <br>
	The project was built from the ground up, using the React App.<br>
	
</p>
