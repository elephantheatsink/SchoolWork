talked to Terry regarding GoDaddy web hosting. Terry said he will get a package today and give us the information to get started on it.

we need to add a column to existing sprinkler database to show which sprinkler has visualization data.
user would need to select sprinkler and it shows the visualization.

we can use whatever method for the user to pick a sprinkler to display visualization.
