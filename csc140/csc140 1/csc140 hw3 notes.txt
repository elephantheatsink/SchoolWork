x= log4 (n)
4^x = n


going from 1 to n
1*4^1
1*4^2

x is the depth
n is te number of terms
it takes log4 (n) depth to get to n


take n
do something n times
something does something else n times

T(n) = theta(n^log2(4)) = theta(n^2)
T(n) = 4T(n/2)+n

1. divide n by 2
2. 4 recurrences using the subproblem
3. if n=1 return the single element
4. 4 recurrences return 4 values to be conquered in n time
